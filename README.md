## DocPad, a Next Generation Web Architecture
On the other hand, let's compare that with DocPad, which is:

- **Inherently fast**
	- Built on a stay alive and non-blocking platform
	- Performance from the ground up, re-render only when changes occur the default
- **Lightweight**
	- Tiny core with anything re-usable abstracted out into a module other systems can use
	- Non essential core functionality moved into opt-in plugins
- **Simple**
	- Tiny learning curve - get started in minutes, and pro within days
	- Web developers already have everything they need to get started
- **Easy**
	- Setting up a new website can be done in minutes
	- In-memory database gives us querying without the need for a manual installation
	- Migrations and deployments are handled via git, the tool we're use to
- **Robust**
	- Use your desktop counterparts to edit content naturally (sublime, vim, word, byword)
	- Abstraction friendly - code the way you want, how you want
	- Use whatever language, pre-processor, markup, templating engine you want - it's all covered via our opt-in plugins
